I decided to use the [API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to get the data out of the Hacker News.

In order to launch the solution: 
- see whether you are okay with the port mapping in `deploy.d/docker-compose.d/docker-compose.override.yml`;
- run `make compose-up`.

If you have any questions â€” ask away.
